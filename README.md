Lower Middle Class ($50-75k): Average spending of $13
Lower Income ($30-50k): Average spending of $7

5. Average Duration of Visits:
Average Duration: 381 minutes
Duration of visits shows an insignificant correlation with amount spent, income, or age of the customer. This suggests that the length of a visit does not strongly influence how much is spent or correlate with demographic factors.

Key Insights:
Age and Spending: Middle-aged customers are the highest spenders on average, indicating that this group is more likely to spend more per transaction. Tailoring promotions to this age group could be beneficial.
Gender-Based Spending: Female customers have higher average spending, suggesting that targeted marketing or loyalty programs for women might yield higher revenue.
Income Impact: There is a clear correlation between income and average spending, with higher-income customers spending significantly more. Offering premium options or personalized services for high-income customers could enhance profitability.
Duration: Since visit duration does not significantly affect spending or correlate with demographic factors, strategies to increase visit duration may not necessarily lead to increased spending.

Offer Analysis
Total Offers Received: Out of the 76k offers distributed by the café, 57k were viewed, and 33k were completed, resulting in an offer conversion rate of 44%.

Offer Type Insights:
Completed Offers: The analysis revealed that only BOGO (Buy One Get One) and discount offers were completed, with no completions for informational offers.
Received Offers: The breakdown of received offers includes 31k discount offers, 30k BOGO offers, and 15k informational offers.
Viewed Offers: Out of the received offers, 25k BOGO, 21k discount, and 11k informational offers were viewed by customers.
Completed Offers: The final completions included 18k discount offers and 16k BOGO offers, emphasizing the effectiveness of these offer types.

Completed Offer Analysis:

Average Difficulty: The average difficulty of completed offers was 9.27.
Average Reward: The average reward for these offers was 4.9.
Average Time: It took an average of 401 units of time for offers to be completed.
Average Duration: The average duration for which offers remained valid was 7.33 units.
Offer Channels: For BOGO and discount offers, the channels used included email, mobile, web, and social platforms, with all channels contributing to the offer completions.
Customer Segmentation: The customer segmentation based on offer completion closely mirrors the initial segmentation. This suggests that the offers were equally effective across the primary customer segments identified earlier (e.g., age, income brackets)

Key Insights:

Offer types:
BOGO and Discount Offers were the only types that led to completions, highlighting their strong appeal to customers.
Informational Offers showed no completions, suggesting they are less effective in driving customer action.

Customer Engagement: A significant proportion of customers viewed the offers: 81% of BOGO offers and 68% of discount offers were viewed, showing high engagement with these offer types. The view-to-completion ratio is relatively strong, particularly for discount offers, where more than half of the viewed offers were completed.

Offer Completion Metrics: The multi-channel approach is working well, and the café could consider optimizing reward levels and offer difficulty to further boost customer engagement and conversion rates.
